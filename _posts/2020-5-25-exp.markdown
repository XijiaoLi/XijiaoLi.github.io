* Worked in the Backend Team & Infrastructure Team at PreVeil.

* Updated the server side logging service by creating a custom logger module that extracts ECS fields and logs in JSON format; worked with the infrastructure team to improve log management by upgrading the classic ELK log architecture and integrating AWS CloudWatch/SNS/Chatbot with the existing data pipelines.

* Migrated the existing email server to Amazon SES to better monitor the bounces and complaints; created email templates using Embedded Elixir to avoid redundant parts of outbound messages.

* Improved RESTful API behavior for client usage; used Unit Testing Framework to formalize requirements, test code, optimize programs, and debug errors.

* Worked with Security Team to design and implement new innovative cryptographic algorithms to address challenges for a wide range of aspects such as secure messaging, device pairing, and cloud data privacy.

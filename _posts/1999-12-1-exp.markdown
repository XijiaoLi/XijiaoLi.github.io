* Worked in the Google Accelerated Science Team at Google AI where we collaborated with chemists and biologists in universities/labs to accelerate drug discoveries with image based cell screening

* Developed a Generative Adversarial Network based model remove batch-to-batch effect in cell imaging including dye intensity, imaging device, lighting condition etc. The multi-domains transformation significantly improve downstream analysis by removing the batch effect biases.

* Opened source the implementations and contributed to Tensorflow and Tensorflow Model
